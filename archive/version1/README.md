# Comparing Methods of Hurricane Forecast Uncertainty with Neural Networks
***
Neural networks are used to estimate consensus hurricane track and intensity errors, as well as the associated uncertainties of the network predictions.

## Tensorflow Code
***
This code was written in python 3.9.7, tensorflow 2.7.0, tensorflow-probability 0.15.0 and numpy 1.21.4. 

## Example use case
